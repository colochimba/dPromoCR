CORS issue
##
Dev Solution: Plugin to turn off the browser’s same-origin policy.
Prod Solution:
-Send the request to a proxy
The one downside of the cors-anywhere proxy is that can often take a while to receive a response. The latency is high enough to make your applications appear a bit sluggish.
##
const proxyurl = "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/";
const url = "https://www.dpromocr.com/json/promos.json";
fetch(proxyurl + url) 
.then(response => response.text())
.then(data => {this.ofertas = JSON.parse(data);})
.catch(() => console.log("Can’t access " + url + " response. Blocked by browser?"))
##
- Create own proxy nodejs
